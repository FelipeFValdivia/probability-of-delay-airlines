# probability-of-delay-airlines

## 1. Install requirements
This solution was created with  Python 3.9.13, and windows 11. To run the project you need to install the previous requirements using pip for Python3. To install requirements, in a terminal, go to the folder of the project, in the root run:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2. About files
The solution of the challenges is in solution.ipynb, you need to run this Jupyter notebook to see the project. In the folder are attached too 3 ipynb files called solution2, solution3 and solution4 that have some of the test runing differents techniques without good performance, then the file doesn't have explanation.

the folder utils contain a python module with utils functions to work with the pandas library to keep the ipynb file clean, traying to get the bigger functions outside of the Jupyter, where I tried to keep with less of code to help with the reading.

The resume is attached as CVFelipeFlores.pdf

Thanks for read!
